Summaries of Projects
StudyJarvis
This personal project is an advanced AI-powered tutor designed for students. The application uses a robust Java backend that exposes a REST API. This backend processes lecture notes uploaded by the user in PDF and PowerPoint formats, storing them in a Google Cloud bucket. The core functionality involves using Google's Gemini LLM to perform a range of tasks, including answering questions based on the notes, generating detailed study guides, creating quizzes, and summarizing key points. The user interface is built using Angular and TypeScript, providing a modern, interactive web experience. The project emphasizes Object-Oriented Design Patterns (Singleton, Command, Strategy, Decorator) and was developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD), ensuring a high level of code quality and reliability through unit, functional, and integration tests.

AI Reference Checker
This project was developed as a member of a Scrum team for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). The application's purpose is to verify quotations in submitted books against their source material on the USCCB website. The backend is a Python server that scrapes the website and uses the Ollama LLM to extract and analyze quotations. The system leverages a SQLite database to manage and compare the data. This project demonstrates his ability to work effectively in an Agile environment, apply his Python skills to develop a practical application, and handle data storage and retrieval in a database context.

Summary of College Paper
The paper, titled "The Legal and Ethical Debate Over AI Art," explores the controversies surrounding generative AI and its impact on human creativity and copyright law.

The paper begins by tracing the technological advancements in generative AI, from the transformer architecture introduced by Google in 2017 to the emergence of text-to-image models like DALL-E in 2022. It then delves into the legal and ethical questions raised by these technologies.

Key points of the paper include:

Legal Challenges: The paper discusses the legal gray areas of AI-generated art, particularly concerning copyright. It analyzes the US Copyright Act of 1976 and the concept of "fair use," arguing that many aspects of AI training sets (commercial use of entire, creative works) favor artists, while the "transformative use" of the art in the final product complicates legal precedents. It cites real-world lawsuits like Getty Images v. Stability AI and Thaler v. Perlmutter, where courts are grappling with who owns the copyright for AI-generated art and whether an AI can be an author.

Ethical Concerns: The paper addresses the fear among human artists that AI will devalue their work and make it impossible to earn a living. It notes that the Catholic Church has begun to address these issues, reflecting on the nature of human creativity, intelligence, and the role of AI. It distinguishes between the intellectual and spiritual aspects of human intelligence (intellectus and ratio) and the purely logical-mathematical capabilities of AI.

Conclusion: The paper concludes by asserting that while AI can generate images quickly, it lacks the spiritual dimension to create true art, which is a human expression of truth and beauty. It argues that software engineers have an ethical responsibility to develop AI as a tool to assist human creativity, not as a replacement for it. This includes respecting intellectual property rights and designing systems that prioritize human flourishing.

Computer Science Course Descriptions
Introduction to Computer Science (CSC-141): This course is a foundational introduction to the field of computer science. It typically covers basic programming concepts, problem-solving techniques, data types, control structures, and an overview of computer systems and software.

Applied Object-Oriented Programming (CSC-171): This class focuses on the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. Students learn to design and implement programs using an object-oriented approach.

Object Oriented Programming (CSC-144): A follow-up to the introductory course, this class would dive deeper into advanced OOP concepts, likely using a specific programming language like Java or C++ to build more complex applications.

Data Structures (CSC-145): This course is a core component of computer science education. It covers the organization and storage of data in computers, including arrays, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. It also explores the algorithms used to manipulate these structures.

Networking/Telecommunications (CSC-256): This class introduces the fundamentals of computer networking. Topics often include network architecture, protocols (like TCP/IP), data transmission, and network security.

Database & Information Processing Systems (CSC-261): He would have learned about the design, implementation, and management of databases. This includes topics such as database models, relational databases, SQL (Structured Query Language), and data integrity.

Introduction to Data Science (CSC-315): This course typically provides an overview of the data science workflow. It covers collecting, cleaning, and analyzing data, as well as an introduction to statistical methods and machine learning algorithms.

Algorithms and Complexity (CSC-344): This is a theoretical course that analyzes the efficiency and performance of algorithms. Students learn to evaluate how different algorithms scale and to prove their correctness.

Current Topics: Web Programming (CSC-351): This class would focus on modern web development technologies. Given his projects, this likely included front-end frameworks like Angular and languages like TypeScript and JavaScript.

Software Patterns in Object-Oriented Programming (CSC-352): This course explores well-established solutions to common design problems in software development. It covers classic design patterns like Singleton, Command, Strategy, and Decorator, which he mentioned using in his StudyJarvis project.

Computer Architecture & Operating Systems (SFE-401): This class delves into the inner workings of a computer system. It would cover the structure of computer hardware, how operating systems manage resources, and the relationship between hardware and software.

Software Testing (SFE-448): This class focuses on the methodologies and techniques used to ensure software quality. It covers different types of testing, such as unit, integration, and system testing, and strategies for finding and fixing bugs.

Senior Capstone Project I & II (SFE-438 & SFE-439): These are typically a two-semester sequence where students work on a significant project, often a team-based effort, to apply the skills and knowledge acquired throughout their degree. His AI Reference Checker project was likely a part of this capstone.

Ethics in Cyberspace (SFE-305): This class explores the moral, legal, and social implications of computing and the internet. It would cover topics like privacy, intellectual property, censorship, and professional responsibility.
